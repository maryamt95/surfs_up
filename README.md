# Surfs_up
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:

### Background

Because of a passion for surfing, I have decided to move back to Hawaii .In fact, I feel so serious about this that I wrote a proposal to start a surf and shake shop. I was able to attract W. Avy to the table, an investor who does want to invest .But based on past experience with a surf shop he asked for analysis on Weather Dataset ,he had, from the area of the proposal before committing.this analysis is to impress the investor and to prove the feasibility and potential of the plan.

### Purpose
The purpose is to provide data and a business I believe will be sustainable year-round and evaluate if it could expand to other islands, and how conditions would vary for bussiness.

### Results:
After recieving W. Avy's data on Hawaii weather collections as a sqllite file, which can be found in this repository. I was able to quickly and succinctly compare values for June and December, meaning this can be done for other months using different queires and for other locations if other datasets for the other islands is accessable.

Here we just focus on Hawaii in June and in Decemeber:
Here are the basic statistics for the two months in comparison: June (F°) December (F°)

Looking at the table :
* Max Temp are not too high, had it been in 90-100 range , it would have been too hot . Hence,heat is not a problem .
* average temperature in these six months didnot chnage that much . Hence lots of people from the northern hemisphere will prefer travelling to this desitination.
* min in June is 64&deg;F , almost 10&deg; more than the minimmum temp recorded in December at 56 &deg;F

### Summary

Heat and good temp is great to consider for a surf shop, but W. Avy mentioned the last surf shop he invested in went under because it got "rained out." We'd want to go above this and also gather data on wave patterns near the specific location we are looking at to attract more of the surfer crowd and also explore the data set with more queries on the weather at large.

Also, as noted above, the temps for the minimum / lowest temp are what are most different between June and December. I would run queries to determine what time of the day is colder, and how long that cold temp in June lasts.
